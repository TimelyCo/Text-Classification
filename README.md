# Text-Classification

End to end code for the email spam classifier project

#Requirements:

Python
Scikit-learn
TensorFlow
Keras

#Dataset:

The dataset used in this project is the bbc-tex dataset, which consists of approximately 2225 text.

#Results:

The results of each model on the bbc-text dataset are as follows:

#Model	Accuracy

Logistic Regression	96.58%
Support Vector Machine	96.94%
Multinomial Naive Bayes	94.97%
Randomforest	95.15%
GradientBoostingClassifier	94.25%
Ensemble Classifier	97.12%
AdaBoost	94.43%
LSTM 1-Layer	99.22%
LSTM 2-Layers	97.78%
GRU	91.74%
CNN+LSTM	98.73%
BERT	99.60%
XLNet	99.46%

#Webapplication:

This web application for multiclass text classification using machine learning and deep learning would allow users to input text data and receive a prediction of the most likely category or label for that text.
